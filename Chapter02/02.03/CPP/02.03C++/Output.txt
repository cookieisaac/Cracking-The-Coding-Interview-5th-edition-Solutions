Original list is a list of size 5: 
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
After deleting the third node, list size is 4
1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
After delete the first node, list size is 3
2 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
We can't delete the last node by this method. After "deleting" node5, the size is 3
2 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
